	decoder: {"epTitle":"How Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola K√§llenius is refocusing for an electric future","epSummary":"Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola K√§llenius became CEO in 2019 but has been working for Mercedes since 1993 in almost every part of the company. During that period, Mercedes spent time getting a lot bigger; the company famously merged with Chrysler for a time, forming a giant called DaimlerChrysler. But, over the past few years, it‚Äôs actually been getting much smaller and more focused. The Chrysler deal was undone and, just recently, Ola spun off the truck division into its own public company called Daimler Truck, leaving Mercedes-Benz to stand alone as a premium car brand.\nCar companies are either consolidating into giant conglomerates like Stellantis or shrinking and focusing like Mercedes. A lot of that is driven by the huge shift to electric vehicles and then, on top of that, to cars essentially becoming rolling computers. You‚Äôll hear Ola refer to cars as ‚Äúdigital products‚Äù a lot ‚Äî and to Mercedes itself as a tech company. (Actually, he says it‚Äôs a luxury and tech company.)\nMercedes now has two new EVs, the EQS and the EQE, both of which have massive infotainment screens running Mercedes‚Äô proprietary MBUX system, which even has its own voice assistant called Hey Mercedes. I had to ask Ola about Apple‚Äôs recent announcement that the next version of CarPlay would be able to take over every display in the car, including the instrument cluster. Apple showed a Mercedes logo on a slide during that presentation ‚Äî so, is Ola ready to hand over his UI to Cupertino?¬†\nLet‚Äôs find out. Ola K√§llenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz.

	sway: {"epTitle":"Would You Upload Your Consciousness to the Cloud?","epSummary":"Instagram, Twitter and TikTok can monopolize all of your time, driven by what the novelist Jennifer Egan calls humankind‚Äôs ‚Äúongoing hunger for authenticity.‚Äù But to Egan, social media is not a winning strategy for discovering what‚Äôs real or true: ‚ÄúLooking to the internet for authentic experience is just inherently a loser,‚Äù she says. The digital world, after all, offers only an ‚Äúillusion of authenticity.‚Äù\n\nIn her newest novel, ‚ÄúThe Candy House‚Äù ‚Äî set in the same universe as her Pulitzer Prize-winning ‚ÄúA Visit From the Goon Squad‚Äù ‚Äî Egan paints a picture of a world where the search for authenticity becomes so ubiquitous that people can choose to upload their memories ‚Äî and entire consciousnesses ‚Äî to a collective archive, and then share them for the world to see.\n\nIn this conversation, Kara Swisher and Egan discuss how far Silicon Valley is from accessing our consciousnesses and introducing this kind of dystopian technology. They debate how social media has changed the world and whether there is still room for optimism. And Kara tries to decipher which tech founder, if any, inspired Egan‚Äôs protagonist, whom Kara describes as Mark Zuckerberg with ‚Äúthe soul of Steve Jobs.‚Äù (Egan, for the record, denies all comparisons.)\n\nYou can find transcripts (posted midday) and more information for all episodes at nytimes.com\/sway, and you can find Kara on Twitter @karaswisher.","epDate":"2022-06-23T14:30:00+05:30"},
