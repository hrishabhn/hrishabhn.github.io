During that period, Mercedes spent time getting a lot bigger; the company famously merged with Chrysler for a time, forming a giant called DaimlerChrysler. But, over the past few years, it‚Äôs actually been getting much smaller and more focused. The Chrysler deal was undone and, just recently, Ola spun off the truck division into its own public company called Daimler Truck, leaving Mercedes-Benz to stand alone as a premium car brand.\nCar companies are either consolidating into giant conglomerates like Stellantis or shrinking and focusing like Mercedes. A lot of that is driven by the huge shift to electric vehicles and then, on top of that, to cars essentially becoming rolling computers. You‚Äôll hear Ola refer to cars as ‚Äúdigital products‚Äù a lot ‚Äî and to Mercedes itself as a tech company. (Actually, he says it‚Äôs a luxury and tech company.)\nMercedes now has two new EVs, the EQS and the EQE, both of which have massive infotainment screens running Mercedes‚Äô proprietary MBUX system, which even has its own voice assistant called Hey Mercedes. I had to ask Ola about Apple‚Äôs recent announcement that the next version of CarPlay would be able to take over every display in the car, including the instrument cluster. Apple showed a Mercedes logo on a slide during that presentation ‚Äî so, is Ola ready to hand over his UI to Cupertino?¬†\nLet‚Äôs find out. Ola K√§llenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz.
