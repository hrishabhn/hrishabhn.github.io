	decoder: {"epTitle":"The videos that don’t work on YouTube and the future of the creator business, with Nebula CEO Dave Wiskus","epSummary":"One of our recurring jokes at The Verge is that every YouTuber eventually makes a video where they talk about how mad they are at YouTube. Whether it’s demonetization or copyright strikes or just the algorithm changing, YouTubers have to contend with a big platform that has a lot of power over their business, and they often don’t have the leverage to push back. \nOn this episode of Decoder, I’m talking to Dave Wiskus, the CEO of two really interesting companies: one is called Standard, which is a management company for YouTubers, and the other is Nebula, an alternative paid streaming platform where creators can post videos, take a direct cut of the revenue, and generally fund work that might get lost on YouTube. \nWhat really stood out to me here is that Dave is in the business of making things: this conversation was really grounded in the reality of the creator business as it exists today and how that real business can support real people. You’ll hear it when we talk about Web3 and NFTs a little bit — Dave just thinks that stuff is b******t, and he says so because it’s not a business that exists now. That’s an important dynamic to think about — and one for more platforms to take seriously.\n\nLinks:\nDave's subscriber tweet\nNebula\n\nTranscript:\nhttps:\/\/www.theverge.com\/e\/22840704\n\nCredits:\nDecoder is a production of The Verge, and part of the Vox Media Podcast Network.\nToday’s episode was produced by Creighton DeSimone and Jackie McDermott and it was edited by Callie Wright.\nThe Decoder music is by Breakmaster Cylinder.

	sway: {"epTitle":"Online Radicalization","epSummary":"A shooter, radicalized online, plotted a racist attack with plenty of digital fingerprints, intended to livestream it on social media and published a manifesto online. It happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. And it seems to have happened again last week in Buffalo. In the years in between, we’ve heard plenty about social media companies amping up their content moderation efforts and clamping down on violent extremism. Yet nothing — or not enough — has really changed.\n\nIn this conversation, Kara Swisher dissects the internet’s role in the Buffalo attack with Wesley Lowery, a journalist who covers race and justice, and Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. The three discuss how extremism spreads online, the role that Fox News and Tucker Carlson play and what platforms like 4chan, Facebook and Twitch could have done differently.\n\nThey also examine the free speech argument made by many conservatives and Elon Musk and consider how a Texas law — which allows individuals to sue platforms if they feel their posts have been censored — may give social media platforms cover to do even less. Lowery points out there are many options between being a “hyper-free-speech absolutist” and “censorship.” Ultimately, as he puts it, these platforms need to ask themselves, “If I’m hosting the block party, do I let the Nazi keep showing up and ranting?”\n\nThis episode contains strong language.\n\nYou can find transcripts (posted midday) and more information for all episodes at nytimes.com\/sway, and you can find Kara on Twitter @karaswisher.","epDate":"2022-05-18T11:00:00+02:00"},
