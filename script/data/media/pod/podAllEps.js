If she wins, she would be the first woman (and the first lesbian) to hold the job in Massachusetts.\n\nIn this episode, Kara presses Healey on how she can appeal to a state that has elected moderate Republicans to the governorship in recent years. She also asks Healey to weigh in on the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill in Florida, which Healey says has to be fought both in the court of law and “in the court of public opinion — you really have to call out the misinformation for what it is.”\n\nYou can find transcripts (posted midday) and more information for all episodes at nytimes.com\/sway, and you can find Kara on Twitter @karaswisher.","epDate":"2022-03-28T11:00:00+02:00"},
