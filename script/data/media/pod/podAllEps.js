It’s one of the biggest events of the year for Apple, one of the most important companies in the world. In fact, Apple is the most valuable company in the world, and it posted $18 billion in net profits in its first quarter — the most quarterly profit of any public company in history.\nSo, as we go into another huge Apple event, I wanted to have Verge labor reporter Zoe Schiffer on to talk about something else that’s happening inside Apple: a brewing push by its retail employees to unionize, store by store, because they’re unhappy with their pay and working conditions. Zoe is really well-sourced; she has an inside look at this fight. So, she helps us explain how this all works and what it might mean.\n\nLinks:\nFired #AppleToo organizer files labor charge against the company\nApple’s frontline employees are struggling to survive\nApple hires anti-union lawyers in escalating union fight\nThis is what Apple retail employees in Atlanta are fighting for\nFirst US Apple Store union election set for June 2nd in Atlanta\nApple accused of union busting in new labor board filing\n\nTranscript:\nhttps:\/\/www.theverge.com\/e\/22917648\n\nCredits:\nDecoder is a production of The Verge, and part of the Vox Media Podcast Network.\nToday’s episode was produced by Creighton DeSimone and Jackie McDermott and it was edited by Callie Wright.\nThe Decoder music is by Breakmaster Cylinder.
