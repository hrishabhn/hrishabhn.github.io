Earlier this year, the Ukrainian government set up wallets on Kuna and other exchanges to accept donations to the war effort in crypto; in April, Bloomberg reported it had received over $60 million in crypto donations.\nWhat‚Äôs more, earlier this year Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signed a virtual assets bill into law, which will recognize cryptocurrency as an asset in Ukraine when the war is over. As president of the Blockchain Association, Michael lobbied for this law, which you‚Äôll hear him talk about ‚Äî especially in the context of how little faith he has in the banking system. He says several times that, even before the war, it couldn‚Äôt be trusted and that people were already using a combination of crypto and dollars for large transactions instead of Ukraine‚Äôs actual currency, which is called the hryvnia.\n\nLinks:\nUkraine Readies NFT Sales as Crypto Donations Top $60 Million\nUkraine's Zelenskyy Signs Virtual Assets Bill Into Law, Legalizing Crypto\nCrypto Goes to War in Ukraine\nBlockchain Association of Ukraine\nRussian tycoon Tinkov sells stake in TCS Group to billionaire Potanin\nThe Bitcoin Boom\nCypriot financial crisis\nThe 2020 Global Crypto Adoption Index: Cryptocurrency is a Global Phenomenon\n\n\nTranscript:\nhttps:\/\/www.theverge.com\/e\/22902506\n\nCredits:\nDecoder is a production of The Verge, and part of the Vox Media Podcast Network.\nToday‚Äôs episode was produced by Creighton DeSimone and Jackie McDermott.
