	decoder: {"epTitle":"The videos that don‚Äôt work on YouTube and the future of the creator business, with Nebula CEO Dave Wiskus","epSummary":"One of our recurring jokes at The Verge is that every YouTuber eventually makes a video where they talk about how mad they are at YouTube. Whether it‚Äôs demonetization or copyright strikes or just the algorithm changing, YouTubers have to contend with a big platform that has a lot of power over their business, and they often don‚Äôt have the leverage to push back.¬†\nOn this episode of Decoder, I‚Äôm talking to Dave Wiskus, the CEO of two really interesting companies: one is called Standard, which is a management company for YouTubers, and the other is Nebula, an alternative paid streaming platform where creators can post videos, take a direct cut of the revenue, and generally fund work that might get lost on YouTube.¬†\nWhat really stood out to me here is that Dave is in the business of making things: this conversation was really grounded in the reality of the creator business as it exists today and how that real business can support real people. You‚Äôll hear it when we talk about Web3 and NFTs a little bit ‚Äî Dave just thinks that stuff is b******t, and he says so because it‚Äôs not a business that exists now. That‚Äôs an important dynamic to think about ‚Äî and one for more platforms to take seriously.\n\nLinks:\nDave's subscriber tweet\nNebula\n\nTranscript:\nhttps:\/\/www.theverge.com\/e\/22840704\n\nCredits:\nDecoder is a production of The Verge, and part of the Vox Media Podcast Network.\nToday‚Äôs episode was produced by Creighton DeSimone and Jackie McDermott and it was edited by Callie Wright.\nThe Decoder music is by Breakmaster Cylinder.
