As president of the Blockchain Association, Michael lobbied for this law, which you‚Äôll hear him talk about ‚Äî especially in the context of how little faith he has in the banking system. He says several times that, even before the war, it couldn‚Äôt be trusted and that people were already using a combination of crypto and dollars for large transactions instead of Ukraine‚Äôs actual currency, which is called the hryvnia.\n\nLinks:\nUkraine Readies NFT Sales as Crypto Donations Top $60 Million\nUkraine's Zelenskyy Signs Virtual Assets Bill Into Law, Legalizing Crypto\nCrypto Goes to War in Ukraine\nBlockchain Association of Ukraine\nRussian tycoon Tinkov sells stake in TCS Group to billionaire Potanin\nThe Bitcoin Boom\nCypriot financial crisis\nThe 2020 Global Crypto Adoption Index: Cryptocurrency is a Global Phenomenon\n\n\nTranscript:\nhttps:\/\/www.theverge.com\/e\/22902506\n\nCredits:\nDecoder is a production of The Verge, and part of the Vox Media Podcast Network.\nToday‚Äôs episode was produced by Creighton DeSimone and Jackie McDermott.

	sway: {"epTitle":"Are Elon Musk and Twitter Trapped In a Bad Marriage?","epSummary":"Elon Musk swept Twitter off its feet in April, when he put in a bid to buy the company for $44 billion. But the impassioned beginnings of this acquisition have cooled down in the weeks since, as Musk has raised concerns about the inner workings of the company he agreed to buy essentially sight unseen (he did not conduct due diligence before he agreed to buy the social media platform). As the New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose puts it, the deal is starting to look ‚Äúlike an arranged marriage that‚Äôs sort of going sour.‚Äù Musk has invoked concerns about spam and fake accounts on the site, as well as privacy considerations. And the billionaire has gone so far as to tweet that the deal is ‚Äútemporarily on hold‚Äù before clarifying that he is ‚Äústill committed to acquisition.‚Äù But a breakup between Musk and Twitter would make for a difficult, costly and very public divorce.\n\nIn this conversation, Kara Swisher takes stock of the Twitter-Musk marriage with Roose and William Cohan, a business writer and founding partner at Puck. They break down the balance of power between Musk and Twitter and discuss why Musk even wants the company. And Cohan breaks down how the math clears ‚Äî after all, even with help from a potpourri of wealthy investors, including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, there are still questions about how Musk, the richest person in the world, will find the tens of billions of dollars he needs to close this deal.\n\nThis episode contains strong language.\n\nYou can find transcripts (posted midday) and more information for all episodes at nytimes.com\/sway, and you can find Kara on Twitter @karaswisher.","epDate":"2022-06-02T11:00:00+02:00"},
